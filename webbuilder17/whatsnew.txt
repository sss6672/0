You can configure whether to allow /disallow the entire website or configure the rules for each folder individually.

Table Of Contents
A Table Of Contents is a list of links that lead to different sections on a page. They're particularly useful for long pages, as they highlight the critical sections of a page in order to improve the reader experience. 
You may know Table Of Content from websites like Wikipedia. Everytime you preview or publish the page, WYSIWYG Web builder will scan the page for heading objects (H1, H2 etc) and update the list. You can also configure the list manually.

Ecommerce
- New feature: Added third party shopping cart checkout integration for Ecwid, Stripe, Snipcart, Paddle, PayPal, Gumroad and Vibracart Pro. The new ecommerce options are available in the events section. So, basically this means that any image, button, text or menu item that supports events can be turned into a checkout button for the supported Payment gateways.
Tip: For Snipcart, Vibracart Pro and Ecwid, if you leave the 'Product ID' empty then the button will act as a checkout/show cart button.
There is also a shortcut button 'Ecommerce' on the Ribbon so you can quickly add ecommerce functionality to a button, image, shape, etc.

Vibracart Pro
Vibracart Pro is a third-party Ecommerce solution. It supports digital (downloads) and physical products. PayPal and / or Stripe are supported for checkout. It has support for coupons, discounts, multiple shipping plans, VAT and lot of other options.
Vibracart Pro is a self-hosted, which mean that the cart runs on your own website. So, you will need to install the product on hte server before you can use it.

Ecwid Shopping Cart
- New feature: With the Ecwid Shopping Cart object you can easily integrate the Ecwid Ecommerce platform into your WYSIWYG Web Builder website. Ecwid is an awesome e-commerce software platform that allows you to add shopping cart functionality to any current site and also get a mobile and Facebook store in one package.  
Ecwid Shopping Cart is a hosted Ecommerce solution. This means that the cart runs on the Ecwid website. So, you do not have to install anything on your own server.
Creating a basic account is free. Upgrade options available for advanced functionality (discount coupons, product downloads, Enhanced SEO capabilities and much more).

All functionality is based on standard Ecwid scripts, so your web shop will run on the Ecwid servers. You can setup products (like name, description, categories pricing, styling) via the Ecwid dashboard.
The following Ecwid widgets are supported:

ECWID - Product Browser 
This is the main container and it is mandatory; this will contain your products, categories, search results, the checkout options etc.

ECWID - Shopping Bag
This widget contains the Shopping Bag; when viewing products, you can Drag & Drop them to the shopping your basket.

ECWID - Category Browser 
Display a list of categories. This controls the content of the Product Browser widget.

ECWID - Search Box
Search for products. The results will be displayed inside the Product Browser widget.

ECWID - Single Product
This makes it possible to display a single product. This can be used instead of the Product Browser widget.

Note: for performance and security reasons the workspace does not display a live preview of the webshop. The workspace will display a place holder. So, you will have to preview or publish the page to see the result. 

PayPal Shopping Cart
- New feature: Added 'PayPal Shopping Cart'. The PayPal Shopping Cart works in combination with the standard PayPal buttons from the Toolbox (Add to Cart and View Cart). But instead of redirecting the users to the PayPal website, the shopping cart will keep the users on your website until they checkout.
PayPal Shopping Cart will show an icon on the website with a badge indicating the number of items in the cart. Clicking the icon will display a popup with the contents of the cart and a checkout button.

PayPal Buttons
- New feature: Added new built-in images: buy now, checkout, PayPal logo and acceptance. Al images are available in large, medium and small sizes.

3. add items, the value is the price
4. In the 'Options' section of the paypal butyon select the ID of the combobox.
- New feature: Input fields (editbox, combobox, spinner) can now be used to update the quantity of the PayPal button. The name of the input should be be 'quantity'.

Image Hotspots
- Improved: The 'Image Hotspots' object is now responsive. Hotspot coordinates will automatically be recalculated when the size of the image changes in a layout grid or breakpoints.
- Improved: Hotspots now have their own ID. This can be used (for example) to show a Popover Card or a Tooltip object.
- New feature: Added the ability to show tooltips for hotspots.
- New feature: Added new 'icon' hotspot. This makes it possible to use icons on the image. Each hotspot can have its own icon and color. It also possible to add a pulsate animation to the icon to grab the attention of the visitor.

Date Picker
- New feature: Added 'focus color' property (for overlay mode). Specifies the outline color for focus state.
- New feature: Added 'Bootstrap Datepicker' modes: date, time or date & time. This can be used as alternative for the jQuery UI date picker.

Input Mask
- New feature: Added 'Input Mask' functionality to Editbox. An inputmask helps the user with the input by ensuring a predefined format. This can be useful for dates, numerics, phone numbers etc.
What's the difference of input masks and validation rules?
input masks are about formatting; validation rules are about correctness of values
Note: there is no direct link between validation and input mask, so you wil need to make sure that the combination masking and validation makes sense.
This feature is based on Inputmask by Robin Herbots (https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask)

Range 
- New feature: Added 'Range' object for use in forms. Implements a slider-like control for entering numbers. You can set a min and max value and steps to define the number intervals. For example: 0.5
The Range object also supports events and conditions! With conditions, the range can be linked with another input field, for example an editbox to display the selected value.

Spinner
- New feature: Added Bootstrap-mode to spinner, in addition to jQuery UI mode.  In Bootstrap mode, up and down buttons are displayed at the left and right side of the input field.
- New feature: Added support for padding. This controls the left and right offset of the text and also affects the size of the spin buttons in Bootstrap mode.
- New feature: Added text alignment property: left, center, right.
- New feature: Added support for conditions. This can be useful to calculate values in a form. For example, calculate the price based on the quantity in a PayPal shopping cart.

Preview
- New feature: Added 'Preview Currently Opened Pages'. This generates the HTML the all pages that are currently open in the workspace (in addition to 'preview current page' and 'preview entire website').
- New feature: Added 'Local Server' preview type. This uses a local server for preview. One of the main reasons why this option was added is to make it possible to preview the website on a mobile device (via your local network) without having to publish the website. Another benefit is that you can add (optional) support for PHP or even setup a local MySQL database server with PHPMyAdmin. 
PHP, MySQL and PHPMyAdmin should be installed separately. Note that PHP, MySQL support are currently experimental and we cannot give support on the setup of these third party tools.

Responsive Web Design
- New feature: Added 'need review' functionality. When using breakpoints, modifications in one view may also affect the layout in other breakpoints. For example, if you have added a new object then you may need to change the size or position in another breakpoint. WYSIWYG Web Builder now shows a 'needs review' icon for those breakpoiints to remind you about this. Also, the site manager can displays a list of pages were one or more breakpoints need to be reviewed. As soon as you switch the breakpoint, the 'needs review' state will be cleared.

HTML
- New feature: Added “Include width and height attributes in images to prevent Cumulative Layout Shifts” option in Tools -> Options -> HTML. This specifies whether to include width and height attributes (width="800" height="600") in <img> tags in addition to CSS.

You can even copy/paste table from Word or Excel. Note however that RTF does not support all Office features.

You can insert a new table via the toolbar, context menu or by entering the following characters
+----------+-------+ and pressing enter.

TAB key
In a table cell, the Tab key goes to the next cell and Shift+Tab goes to the previous cell (if any).
If the selection is in the last cell of a table, the Tab key inserts a new row after the last row.

Enter key

You can select the slim version if you are just using basic features like simple events (without effects) or Bootstrap based widgets.
jQuery UI widgets require the full version because they use the effects module. Also, Instagram integration uses ajax so this also require the full version. So, make sure test all the functionality of the page to make sure everything works correct with the slim version.
